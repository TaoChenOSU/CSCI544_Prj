# genre classifier for lyrics

This is a classifier that can distinguish the genre of a song by analysing the lyrics of that song. Intuition is from the course project of USC CSCI 544.

We propose multiple classfiers against a baseline algorithm to compare the performance of different natural language processing methods.
