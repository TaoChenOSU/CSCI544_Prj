('Ho!'), Say 'Ho!' ('Ho!')\nAnd to let me know I'm rocking the microphone everybody say 'Ramo!' ('Ramo!')\n'Ramo!' ('Ramo!')\nRaah!\n\nA newspaper burns in the sand, and the headlines say 'Man destroys Man!'\nExtra! Extra! Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose\nThe rise and fall, the last great empire, the sound of the whole world caught on fire\nThe ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble\nThe game that left the whole world in shambles\nThe cheats, the lies, the alibis\nAnd the foolish attempt to conquer the skies\nLost in space, and what is it worth, huh?\nThe president just forgot about Earth\nSpending multi billions, and maybe even trillions\nThe cost of weapons ran into zillions\nThere's gold in the street, and diamonds under feet\nAnd the children in Africa don't even eat\nFlies on their faces, they're living like mice\nAnd the houses even make the ghetto look nice, Huh!\nThe water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny\nAnd they work all month and don't make no money\nA fight for power, a nuclear shower\nAnd people shout out in the darkest hour\nOf sights unseen and voices unheard\nAnd finally the bomb gets the last word\nChristians killed Muslims, and Germans killed Jews\nAnd everybody's bodies are used and abused, Huh!\nMinds are poisoned and souls are polluted\nSuperiority complex is deep rooted\nLeeches and lice's, and people got prices\nEgomaniacs control the self-righteous\nNothing is sacred and nothing is pure\nSo the revelation of death is our cure\nHitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan\nNapoleon, Castro, Mussolini and Begin\nGhengis Khan and the Shah of Iran\nMixed with the blood of the weaker man\nThe peoples in terror, the leaders made the error\nAnd now they can't even look in the mirror\n'Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher\nAnd that's the reason why we got to get tougher\nTo learn from the past and work for the future\nAnd don't be a slave to no computer\n'Cause the Children of Man inherits the land\nAnd the future of the world is in your hands\nSo just throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nAnd if you believe that you're the future\nScream it out and say 'Oh yeah!' ('Oh yeah!')\n'Oh yeah!' ('Oh yeah!')\nRaah!\n\nBeat Street Breakdown\nRaah!\nHip Hop!\n\n",
