I shoulda never come to this\nSo holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo I'll be over here\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nOh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?\nOh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here\nAnd I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here\n\n"

You've been moping around\nYou need to find a mountaintop, and get out of this town\nShe says, sometimes, you gotta get away\nClear out that noggin, open up the day\n\n[Chorus]\nAbove the timberline\nThe higher I go, the harder I climb\nI'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind\nLove shines bright above the timberline\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow things get slower when it's harder to breathe\nI can almost touch the stars that are hanging over me\nYou've never been more beautiful, and it's easy to see\nAll that really matters, you're all I'll ever need\n\nI'm getting to the bottom at the top of the world\nLeaving trivialities parked down at the curb\nAll that noise between us, now it can't be heard\nI'm listening to the wind, I'm writing down the words\n\n[Chorus]\nAbove the timberline\nThe higher I go, the harder I climb\nI'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind\nLove shines bright above the timberline\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I'll be coming home, I'll be coming home soon\nBefore I head on down I'm gonna kiss the moon\n\n[Chorus]\nAbove the timberline\nThe higher I go, the harder I climb\nI'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind\nLove shines bright above the timberline\n\n[Outro]\nAbove the timberline\nNo hitting the brakes, no waiting in line\nThe farther you go, the higher you'll climb\nLove shines bright above the timberline\n\n"

Can't go back again...\nI got a reason to be fevered-summer waking morn\nBack back when the poor poor boy was born\n\nNow cross into his fortune. While enchanted by the queen\nA lone shady shelter stood beckoning his lean\nAnd in the time it takes a pillow to figure out a face\nOut from in the white tree she rose to take its place\n\nAnd the battle for his spirit then caused him to remain\nAnd he fought as a thousand Visigoths and he cursed the night in vain\nShe said run away run away if you can\nBut last he heard a voice of...I'm my own man and this is my life...\n\nOff to in her castle, laid upon the stairs\nShe showered him with daffodils and tied ribbons in his hair\nHe woke for bare a moment but she wouldn't let him weep\nWith lips of only roses kissed him down to sleep\n\nSo royal loyal subjects now let your ears unbend\nFor here ye this traveled tail must sadly meet it's end\nWhat's fate done to our hero I cannot reply...\nThe last that I saw him, a flection in her eye\n\n"
