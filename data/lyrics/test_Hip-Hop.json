fight the beast\nSo united we stand but we gonna fall quick\nBecause we always tryin to take another brother's shit\nAnd the cops is in the same vote\nJust because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope\nThey shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods\nThey shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood\nAnd now the story's all twisted up\nAnd if they gave the cop the chair\nI really wouldn't give a fuck\nBecause she left my partner's family with memories\nAnd after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me\nBut yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch\nI see his parents and then I started breakin' up\nBecause I know what you did was wrong\nBut you won't realize until you dead and gone\nIt ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning\nYou straight up shot him from behind\nBut all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back\nYou give a gat to a black he don't know how to act\nBut you gotta tell your story to the judge\nNot the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves\nAnd if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness\nThen in reality you took care of your business\nBut regardless I know you wanna kill me\nBut I ain't goin' out like dat\nYa feel me?\n\n...yeah\n\n"
