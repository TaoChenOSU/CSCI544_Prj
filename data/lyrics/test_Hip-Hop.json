life would've been joke\nEither locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope\nThe lord he had a plan for me\nAnd with his help, my mother made a man of me\nDidn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in\nTaught me how to save my little dividends\nSo when I graduated I'd have a little school money\nBut in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy\nAnd flunked outta school with the flag pole\nAnd left my mother dear at home with a sad soul\nBecause my mother worked the fingers to the bone\nCause we was alone, and me I bought an F home\nMy real pops he broke out with the style\nSo I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child\nSo now we livin' comftable\nTaught me the game and how to be responsible\nBut back then I couldn't see it\nI wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'\nAnd ended up in a big fight\nAnd told me not to come home until I got my shit right\nSo now I'm livin' in my grandma's home\nMy grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own\nAnd keepin' me ain't no big deal\nBut now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels\nBeing kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no\nEven though my grandfather just had a stroke\nAnd now the money's low\nAnd pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go\nOr either try to find a job so I can help out\nI'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out\nAnd when I get out I gotta try to pave the way\nSo my family can have a better place to stay\nI'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short\nI can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope\nAnd now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong\nShe just prayin' for me heavily\nTake care of her grandson\nAnd the lord must of heard her prayer\nCause he made me get a grip\nAnd got me on up outta there\nI heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya\nYou couldn't have told me nothin' back then\nBut now I feel ya...\n\nI'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun\nMy baby's mother just had my first son\nMay eleven, I never will forget the day\nA star's born, let's name him little Scarface\nMy first born and yo I'm a proud father\nI gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father\nAnd sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead\nBut what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed\nI buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part\nAnd he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard\nI buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys\nBecause the Tonka toys will only punk my boy\nAnd I don't want my son to look at life\nThrough a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like\nBut yet and still I let my son be a kid\nJust give him up the real, exactly like my momma did\nSo when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate\nThe game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate\nAnd now my son is four years old\nI really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role\nBecause these years he'll remember most\nSo it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close\nBut I got a buncha obstacles\nIf it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle\nNow everybody's got my baby\nWantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy\n\"It's your daughter, don't she look like you?\"\nI just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do\nBecause my mother knows the real deal\nAll these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal\nSo now we in and outta cope\nTryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support\nTellin' her friends that she's breakin' me\nNow eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G\nCome to find out, the girl never had me\nShe's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy\nAnd biological tests can prove\nYou gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude\nBut now I finally got a real daughter\nNo need for the testin'\nI know that I'm the baby's father\nI heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya\nYou couldn't have told me nothin' back then\nBut now I feel ya...\n\nI feel ya...\n\nNow I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life\nIt's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife\nAnd got a bigger stick to fight with\nI'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick\nBecause we livin' in a concentration set\nAnd everyday, we face to face with death\nI seen my homies go and come\nAnd judgement day is just somethin we can't run from\nSo I know my number's comin' up\nSo I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up\nAnd even though I hate killin' off my own kind\nI gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine\nMy brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace\nDon't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast\nSo united we stand but we gonna fall quick\nBecause we always tryin to take another brother's shit\nAnd the cops is in the same vote\nJust because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope\nThey shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods\nThey shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood\nAnd now the story's all twisted up\nAnd if they gave the cop the chair\nI really wouldn't give a fuck\nBecause she left my partner's family with memories\nAnd after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me\nBut yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch\nI see his parents and then I started breakin' up\nBecause I know what you did was wrong\nBut you won't realize until you dead and gone\nIt ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning\nYou straight up shot him from behind\nBut all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back\nYou give a gat to a black he don't know how to act\nBut you gotta tell your story to the judge\nNot the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves\nAnd if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness\nThen in reality you took care of your business\nBut regardless I know you wanna kill me\nBut I ain't goin' out like dat\nYa feel me?\n\n...yeah\n\n"

Everything up here in the mountains aggravates me, Makes me want to occupy my time with murder, pain and the suffering of others who live life and enjoy it. Running away from the noise and silence and torture that scare them running towards sunlight and sprouting flowers. And I am an ant and butterfly and life turns to anguish\n\n"

Man, how you do that there?\nGoddamn I wanna do that there\nSo I went home and wrote my first rhyyyme, for the first tiiime\nDidn't know nothin' 'bout no bar, so I called it my first rap line\nIn due time, I was rappin' to the beats of Run-D.M.C.(Run-errie-Run)\nLearnin' from the super staaars\nWe they rap - I start rappin', when they stopped - I stopped\nThat's how I learned to count sixteen baaars\nEvery chance I got, I showed my talent\n'Cause every month this lady Coon throwed a talent show in Cedar Park\nWe did it for love, we didn't know nothin' bout know spinnin' rims or candy cars\nThe tips we got, we bought M&M's and candy bars\nPlus at that time, I was still rappin' by myself\nI hit eighth grade, then realized that I needed some help\nMy first time tryin' to find a partner, man I went through a dozen(psssss)\nI went home one day and somethin' said, \"Mayne, listen to your cousin\"\nHis first rap - THIS NIGGA SNAPPED, first two bars: fightin' and shootin'\nAnd every day - black bandana - retro J's - Nike suits, and\nBig gold chains, and bad bitches that like to give brain\nHey, that's my kinda rap, shiet we one in the same\nSimple and plain, the rest is history\nA quick summary on how I met Mr. G\nBut since that time, our life don' got better\n'Stead of.. rappin' for dips of chocolate, we rappin' for whips and cheddar\nFo' real, we don' paid our dues...me and my lil' cousin, we don' paid our dues\n\n[Chorus] *fades out*\n\n"

Everybody eyes on us look and listen to me, everything gon be fine. Ya brighten up my days when the sun don't shine.

So if U wanna holla, holla back! Cause shawty know she lookin like whooaaaa. Shawty know she stuntin like whooaaaa and shawty know she lookin right. Shawty know she stuntin like whooaaaa!\n\n[Verse 2:]\nJust like I told ya... After all of this over when da smoke clear from da dosha, still gon have U a shoulder fo to lean on. No roses, I don't need dat to show ya, I know ya feel it when I hold ya, dat I love yo ass more den anything! Den I'm sayen we done been threw da pain and all da rain, done dried up!
