Everything up here in the mountains aggravates me, Makes me want to occupy my time with murder, pain and the suffering of others who live life and enjoy it. Running away from the noise and silence and torture that scare them running towards sunlight and sprouting flowers. And I am an ant and butterfly and life turns to anguish\n\n"

Man, how you do that there?\nGoddamn I wanna do that there\nSo I went home and wrote my first rhyyyme, for the first tiiime\nDidn't know nothin' 'bout no bar, so I called it my first rap line\nIn due time, I was rappin' to the beats of Run-D.M.C.(Run-errie-Run)\nLearnin' from the super staaars\nWe they rap - I start rappin', when they stopped - I stopped\nThat's how I learned to count sixteen baaars\nEvery chance I got, I showed my talent\n'Cause every month this lady Coon throwed a talent show in Cedar Park\nWe did it for love, we didn't know nothin' bout know spinnin' rims or candy cars\nThe tips we got, we bought M&M's and candy bars\nPlus at that time, I was still rappin' by myself\nI hit eighth grade, then realized that I needed some help\nMy first time tryin' to find a partner, man I went through a dozen(psssss)\nI went home one day and somethin' said, \"Mayne, listen to your cousin\"\nHis first rap - THIS NIGGA SNAPPED, first two bars: fightin' and shootin'\nAnd every day - black bandana - retro J's - Nike suits, and\nBig gold chains, and bad bitches that like to give brain\nHey, that's my kinda rap, shiet we one in the same\nSimple and plain, the rest is history\nA quick summary on how I met Mr. G\nBut since that time, our life don' got better\n'Stead of.. rappin' for dips of chocolate, we rappin' for whips and cheddar\nFo' real, we don' paid our dues...me and my lil' cousin, we don' paid our dues\n\n[Chorus] *fades out*\n\n"

Everybody eyes on us look and listen to me, everything gon be fine. Ya brighten up my days when the sun don't shine.

So if U wanna holla, holla back! Cause shawty know she lookin like whooaaaa. Shawty know she stuntin like whooaaaa and shawty know she lookin right. Shawty know she stuntin like whooaaaa!\n\n[Verse 2:]\nJust like I told ya... After all of this over when da smoke clear from da dosha, still gon have U a shoulder fo to lean on. No roses, I don't need dat to show ya, I know ya feel it when I hold ya, dat I love yo ass more den anything! Den I'm sayen we done been threw da pain and all da rain, done dried up!
